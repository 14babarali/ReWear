              Re-Wear is an innovative online platform that transforms how people buy and sell secondhand clothing and access tailoring services. It provides a unique space where buyers can find both pre-loved and new clothes, while sellers and tailors can create their own stores to offer products and services. Re-Wear promotes sustainability by encouraging the reuse of clothing and making fashion more accessible and eco-friendly.
